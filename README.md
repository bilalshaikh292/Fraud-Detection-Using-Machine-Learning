# Fraud Detection System

Welcome to our Fraud Detection System project! This system utilizes Machine Learning to create a robust fraud detection model trained on a real-life credit card transactions dataset. We compare the performance of various models, including Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, and Naive Bayes, to ensure accurate and efficient fraud detection.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models:** We employ advanced ML algorithms to analyze credit card transactions and identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities.
- **Model Comparison:** The project evaluates the performance of Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, and Naive Bayes models to choose the most effective approach for fraud detection.
- **Fast API Deployment:** The fraud detection model is deployed using Fast API, ensuring a fast and efficient API endpoint for real-time fraud prevention.
- **Frontend & Backend Integration:** The system seamlessly integrates with a user-friendly frontend and a robust backend. We use React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Express as the web application framework.
- **Tailwind CSS:** The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and modern design for a seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, pandas.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Fast API.
- **Frontend:** React.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
